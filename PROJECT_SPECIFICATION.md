# Chalishiya High School Management System - Project Specification

## Introduction

This document outlines the project specification for a comprehensive, web-based School Management System for **Chalishiya High School**. The system aims to digitize and streamline the school's administrative and academic operations, making them more efficient and accessible for staff, students, and parents.

Given the school's rural location, the system will be designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and functional even with potential internet connectivity constraints.

## 1. Core Modules

The system will be developed in phases. The following modules are considered **essential** for the initial release (Phase 1).

*   **Student Information Management:** A central database for all student records, including personal details, contact information, admission data, and assigned class.
*   **Teacher and Staff Management:** Profiles for all teachers and administrative staff, including their contact details, assigned subjects, and roles.
*   **Academic Records and Grading:** Management of subjects, classes, and academic sessions. Teachers can input marks, and the system will automatically calculate grades and GPA based on the Bangladeshi education system's scale.
*   **Attendance Tracking:** Teachers can take daily attendance for their classes. The system will generate monthly and yearly attendance reports for each student.
*   **Fee Management:** Admins can create fee structures (e.g., monthly tuition, exam fees), track payments for each student, generate invoices, and view payment statuses.
*   **Communication System:** An internal messaging and notice board system for broadcasting announcements to teachers, students, and parents.

### Recommended for Phase 2

*   **Examination Management:** Full lifecycle management of exams, from creating schedules and seating plans to publishing results online.
*   **Library Management:** A system to catalog books, manage check-ins and check-outs, and track library inventory.

## 2. Technical Requirements

*   **Platform:** A **responsive web-based application** that is accessible from any device with a web browser (desktop, tablet, mobile). A dedicated mobile app is a potential future extension.
*   **User Roles and Permissions:** The system will have role-based access control with the following initial roles:
    *   **Administrator:** Full access to all modules. Can manage settings, users, and financial data.
    *   **Teacher:** Access to modules for attendance, grading, and communication with their assigned classes.
    *   **Student:** Can view their own profile, attendance, results, and school notices.
    *   **Parent/Guardian:** Can view their child's profile, attendance, results, fee status, and communicate with teachers.
*   **Database Requirements:** A relational database such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for data integrity and scalability.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Authentication:** Secure login with password hashing.
    *   **Authorization:** Strict role-based access control to prevent unauthorized data access.
    *   **Data Protection:** Use of HTTPS/SSL for data encryption in transit.
    *   **Vulnerability Prevention:** Protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Integration Needs:** The system should be designed with future integration in mind, particularly with the **Jashore Education Board portal** for streamlined data submission if an API becomes available.

## 3. Specific Features

*   **Tailored to Bangladesh's Education System:**
    *   Supports the GPA 5.0 grading scale.
    *   Manages class structures from 6 to 10.
    *   Handles subject management as per the national curriculum (e.g., mandatory, elective).
*   **Multi-language Support:** The entire user interface will be available in both **Bengali** and **English**.
*   **Reporting Capabilities:**
    *   Generate student report cards (progress reports).
    *   Create attendance summary reports.
    *   Produce financial reports on fee collection.
*   **Parent/Guardian Portal:** A secure portal for parents to log in and access real-time information about their child's academic life.

## 4. System Architecture (High-Level)

A **monolithic architecture** using a proven web framework (e.g., Django, Laravel, ASP.NET Core) is recommended. This approach simplifies development, deployment, and maintenance for a project of this scale.

**Client (Browser) <--> Web Server (Application Logic) <--> Database**

## 5. User Stories (Examples)

*   **Admin:** "As an administrator, I want to add a new student's record with their personal details and assign them to Class 7, so that they are officially enrolled."
*   **Teacher:** "As a teacher, I want to take daily attendance for my Bangla class on my mobile phone, so that I can quickly record who is present or absent."
*   **Parent:** "As a parent, I want to log in to the portal and see my child's results from the half-yearly exam, so I can understand their academic performance."
*   **Student:** "As a student, I want to check the notice board for any updates about the upcoming sports day, so I don't miss any important announcements."

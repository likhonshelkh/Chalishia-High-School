# Project Overview: Chalishiya High School Management System

## 1. Core Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to build a comprehensive, web-based School Management System for **Chalishiya High School**. The system will digitize and streamline the school's administrative and academic operations.

**Key Document:** For a full breakdown of features, modules, and technical requirements, **always consult the [Project Specification](../PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md).**

## 2. Current Status

**IMPORTANT:** This project is currently in the **documentation phase**. No application code has been written yet. The build and test commands defined in `AGENTS.md` are placeholders and will fail if executed. Do not attempt to run them until the project is formally initialized.

## 3. Key Architectural Decisions

*   **Platform:** Responsive web-based application.
*   **Architecture:** Monolithic (e.g., Django, Laravel).
*   **Database:** Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   **Languages:** A backend language (e.g., Python, PHP) and frontend languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **Multi-language Support:** The UI must support both **Bengali** and **English**.

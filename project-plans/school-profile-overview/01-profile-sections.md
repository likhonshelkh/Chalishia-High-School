# Phase 1 â€“ Profile Content Sections (school-profile-overview)

> **STOP after completing the tasks below.** Do not continue to later phases without explicit approval.

## Goal
Introduce rich school profile content to the landing page that reflects the latest Chalishia High School research data while preserving accessibility and responsiveness.

## Deliverables
- `src/components/quick-stats.tsx` updated with accurate student, teacher, staff, and land statistics sourced from the official profile document.
- `src/components/school-overview.tsx` created to present history, location, and governance highlights using semantic sections and Bengali-first copy.
- `src/components/campus-facilities.tsx` added summarizing land area, classrooms, and extracurricular offerings with iconography aligned to the existing design system.
- `src/app/page.tsx` amended to render the new overview and facilities components beneath the existing quick menus.

## Checklist (implementer)
- [x] Ensured every touched source file includes the mandated repository file header.
- [x] Verified that new components export typed props (or `FC`) and avoid implicit `any` usage.
- [x] Confirmed the content faithfully represents the referenced profile data without unsupported claims.
- [x] Ran `pnpm lint` and resolved all reported issues.

## Self-verify
Run the following commands before marking the phase complete:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

STOP. Wait for Phase 1a verification.

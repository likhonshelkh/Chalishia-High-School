# Phase 2a – Verification of Structured Content Extraction (school-profile-overview)

## Verification Steps
1. Confirm every checklist item in `project-plans/school-profile-overview/02-structured-content.md` is marked `[x]`.
2. Check that the new data modules in `src/data/` export plain objects or arrays without JSX by searching for `<` characters inside those files.
3. Ensure `src/types/content.ts` exists, defines interfaces for quick stats, overview highlights, facilities, and services, and each consuming component imports from it.
4. Verify that layout elements live under `src/components/layout/`, shared primitives under `src/components/shared/`, and content sections under `src/components/sections/` with no remaining duplicates at the root `components/` directory.
5. Inspect `src/app/page.tsx` to confirm imports reference the new paths and render order remains Header → Navigation → NewsTicker → MainContent → QuickStats → SchoolOverview → CampusFacilities → Footer.
6. Run `pnpm lint` and ensure it passes without warnings or errors.

## Outcome
- Emit `✅` if every step succeeds.
- Otherwise, list each failing step prefixed with `❌`.
